# Project Base - Flask

I like everything to get out of my way when working on a project, especially
when I start. Recently I started using Flask as it allows me to get up and
running really quickly and almost immediately get to the important stuff.

So this is my project base with a keen focus on simplicity. I doubt I'll add
much more to it as it is already quite refined.
